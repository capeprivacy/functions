# Cape Functions

## Getting Started

To run these functions with Cape, you need to first install the [Cape CLI](https://github.com/capeprivacy/cli).

### Cape Login

Log in to Cape by running:
```
cape login
```

### Cape Deploy

Deploys your function and any dependencies within a `function_dir` to Cape. Returns a `function_id`:

```
cape deploy <function_dir>
```

For example, if your function code was within a folder named `echo`:
```
cape deploy echo
```

#### Deploying on Windows

If you are on Windows (or as an alternative to deploying the function as a directory) you can create a zip file and deploy it directly. This will fix issues you may run into with relative paths:

```
cape deploy <function_name>.zip
```

### Cape Run

Runs a cape function by `function_id` and takes `input_data`. Returns the result of the function:

```
cape run <function_id> <input_data>
```

to pass `input_data` as a file, use `-f`:
```
cape run <function_id> -f <input_file>
```


## Examples

### echo

A simple function that returns whatever you send it. Checkout the folder [echo](.echo/) to learn how to deploy this function. To invoke this function, you can run the following:

```
cape run capedocs/echo -f echo/input.echo.data
```

### isprime

A simple function checking if your number is prime or not. Checkout the folder [isprime](.isprime/) to learn how to deploy this function. To invoke this function, you can run the following:

```
cape run capedocs/isprime -f isprime/input.isprime.data
```

### pendulum
In this example, we show how to run a function requiring a dependency. The function simply returns the current time based on a specific timezone using the [Pendulum](https://pendulum.eustace.io/) library. To learn how to deploy this function, checkout the folder [pendulum](./pendulum/). To invoke the function, invoke:

```
cape run capedocs/pendulum Europe/Paris 
```

### np-stats
A simple example with numpy dependencies and using [pycape](https://github.com/capeprivacy/pycape) and [serdio.lift_io](https://pydocs.capeprivacy.com/serdio.io_lifter.html#serdio.io_lifter.lift_io) to handle automatic serialization/deserialization of Cape function input/outputs. You can learn how to deploy this function by checking the folder [np-stats](./np-stats/). You can run the function as follow after install installing in a virtual environment in `np-stats/requirements.txt`:

```
export TOKEN=<YOUR TOKEN>
export FUNCTION_ID=capedocs/np-stats
python np-stats/run.py
```

### secure-search
Simulates a cybersecurity search function, where the IP addresses you are interested in need to remain private but the data/logs you are searching might be public. You can learn more about this function by checking the folder [secure-search](./secure_search/).

```
cape run capedocs/secure-search -f secure-search/input.search.data
```

### leader-election
Demos how secure trusted execution environment like Cape can be leveraged in consensus in order to guarantee fairness. Details on how to run this example can be found
[here](./leader-election)


### hide-and-seek
To learn more about the confidential hide and seek example, you can check the folder [hide_and_seek](./hide_and_seek).


### mortgage
This application is a mortgage calculator that computes if an applicant is eligible for a mortgage. To learn how to deploy this application, you an checkout the folder (mortgage)[./mortgage]. To call this function, you can run:
```
cape run capedocs/mortgage -f input.mortgage.json
```

## Machine Learning examples

### Image Classification Inference with ONNX

To learn how you can deploy and invoke an image classification model using the [onnxruntime], you can check the [capeprivacy/image-classification-onnx](image-classification-onnxhttps://github.com/capeprivacy/image-classification-onnx) repository.


### Image Classification with tflite
This example demonstrates how you can deploy and invoke an image classification model with [tflite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite). To learn how to deploy this application, you can checkout the folder [image-classification](image_recognition). To invoke the model, simply run:

```
cape run capedocs/image_classification -f image_classification/coffee.jpg

('Image Label is :', 'espresso', ', with Accuracy :', 84.38, '%.')
```
